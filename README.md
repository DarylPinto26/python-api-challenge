API Module 6 challenge with Python for UofT Bootcamp course in Data Analytics and Visualization.

The challenge is completed in two parts and displayed in two files - "WeatherPy.ipynb" and "VacationPy.ipynb" situated in the "WeatherPy" directory

The code was written and edited using Jupyter Notebook.

All code has been used and reviewed with the help of study material collected personally during the UofT bootcamp course classroom hours.

The code written to define the linear regression function(in WeatherPy.ipynb file) used references from various sources on GitHub to get a better understanding of the concept.

api_keys.py was added to  .gitignore file hence not visible on the remote Repository.

The following challenge covered Python concepts such as - Python Requests, APIs, and JSON transversals, Defining Functions, matplotlib, Pandas, and Linear Regression Applications and NumPy.
